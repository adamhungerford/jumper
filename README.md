A quick web-based challenge in mobile design.
## Goals and Accomplishments
I worked on Jumper for about three days in August. My goal was to explore the possibilities of web-based document design, and within the framework of a simple pencil-and-paper game, I was able to:
- utilize JavaScript's power to create dynamic decks of cards and dice
- use mobile-first design to create an intuitive document
- stay true to my commitments to accessibility 

I'm quite proud of this piece, even if it's small. See the finished product [here](https://edhungerford.github.io/jumper/).
